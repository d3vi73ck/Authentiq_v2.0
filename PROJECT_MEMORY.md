# Authentiq Project Memory

## Project Overview

**Authentiq** is a comprehensive expense justification platform designed specifically for NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations). The platform provides multi-tenant architecture allowing NGOs to manage multiple organizations, projects, and teams under a single account with separate data isolation and role-based access controls.

### Business Purpose
- **Primary Goal**: Streamline expense validation processes for NGOs
- **Target Users**: NGO administrators, finance teams, project managers, and auditors
- **Key Value**: AI-powered document verification and multi-tenant management for expense compliance

### Core Features
1. **Multi-tenant Expense Management**
2. **Document Upload and Verification**
3. **AI-Powered OCR and Analysis**
4. **Role-Based Access Control**
5. **Multi-language Support (English/French)**
6. **Secure File Storage**
7. **Review and Approval Workflows**

## Technical Architecture

**File Processing Pipeline**
1. File upload with validation
2. OCR text extraction (Tesseract.js)
3. AI analysis (planned)
4. Background processing for performance

## Key Implementation Details

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

**Subdomain-Based Routing**
- Tenant identification from hostname
- Reserved subdomain protection (www, admin, app)
- Organization context propagation via headers

**Data Isolation**

- `GET /api/upload` - List files for submission

**Review System**
- `GET /api/review` - List submissions pending review
- `POST /api/review` - Submit review decision with comment

### Frontend Components

**Core Pages**
- `/submissions` - Submission list with filtering
- `/submissions/new` - Create new expense submission
- `/submissions/[id]` - Submission details and file management
- `/review` - Review dashboard for approvers

**Key Components**
- `FileDrop` - Drag-and-drop file upload with validation
- `ReviewPanel` - Review interface with decision making
- `CommentSection` - Discussion and feedback system
